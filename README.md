mgl (Mini Game programming Library)
======================
Mgl is a flash mini game programming library for my own use. Mgi is useful for creating a mini game with a terrible unreadable code.

[Sample game (TOSSED HUMANS SPLIT OVER)](http://wonderfl.net/c/d8Rm "TOSSED HUMANS SPLIT OVER")

[Sample game (WASD THRUST)](http://wonderfl.net/c/cUIn "WASD THRUST") (using the older version mgl)

Using the [SiON](https://github.com/keim/SiON "SiON") synthesizer library.
